## LoadFiles

This is a utility to create managed-data-assets json files from database tables.
Not used in the running of the program, but useful for backing it up.

You will need to run ```make install``` in the src/bedrock_common/bedrock_common directory 
before running ```npm install; node load_files.js;``` here
